The shower is outside the sauna, but really the water in the lake is so warm, that we never used that shower. The forest around the cottage is amazing and full of life. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Also, please take into account that you need to have enough space in your trunk to pick up your garbage (the nearest landfill is the West Guilford Landfill site), don't repeat our mistake.

The lake was nice and warm for swimming and with lots of seating both at the water and around the fire pit there was always somewhere to relax and enjoy nature. We didn't get to use the sauna this time around, but it looked great and we will be sure to next time. There were enough beds for everyone (all nice and clean) so no one had to sleep on a couch. The fire pit had grills for cooking, so we were able to stay outside all weekend, not getting cooped up in the cottage. I would absolutely recommend this property to anyone looking for a nice getaway from the busy world. I will 100% be returning to David's cottage.\",\n",

If you do not need a phone for a weekend this is truly the place to stay. Authentic cottage, separate bunky cabin, sauna, outdoor shower... 10/10 stay, would book again.

The cottage has a unique rustic feel about it but is very intelligently designed and comfortable. Our weekend was exceptionally rainy, and so the sauna was another magical corner for hanging out. David was a great host -- really easy going and very helpful. Our group is definitely planning on coming back. Thanks David! ',\n",

If you appreciate historic amenities, like iron wood fire stoves and antique ice boxes, this place doubles as an awesome museum for Ontario history. The beds were quite comfortable and the cabin clean and tidy when we arrived. The sauna and outdoor tub added to the trip’s rustic luxury. Stay to the right on the little dirt road, and just when you think you’re lost, you’ll find yourself in a little forest oasis. Bring a rod, and hit the dock. Well worth the journey from Alaska.',\n",

We didn't get to use the sauna this time around, but it looked great and we will be sure to next time. There were enough beds for everyone (all nice and clean) so no one had to sleep on a couch.

       "'[\"Incredibly unique and beautiful spot. There is no other property like it. It\\'s very private and ideal for a modest outdoorsman. There are more than enough touches to make it a comfortable stay. The lake and sauna are very relaxing and should definitely be enjoyed. The cabin is very well equipped and comes with chopped firewood so the stay can be easy. Dave was a great host and a phone call away to answer our questions. Will definitely consider returning!!\", \"This cottage offers a rare opportunity it experience Canadian beauty without intrusion from the outside world. Clean and comfortable an all round amazing trip.\", \"Our stay at Michabo lake was fantastic. The cabin and bunkie were tidy, the beds were comfortable, and the lake was great for swimming and fishing. It was very private. We had plenty of cooking amenities, and the hot water from the sauna was great for showers and doing dishes. All in all a very relaxing weekend at the lake.\", \"This is an OUTSTANDING place! It is extremely rare that you can find such a secluded place with all lake just for you. The cottage actually has everything that you need, it accomdates 10 people comfortably, and everything is in good condition. The shower is outside the sauna, but really the water in the lake is so warm, that we never used that shower. The forest around the cottage is amazing and full of life. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Also, please take into account that you need to have enough space in your trunk to pick up your garbage (the nearest landfill is the West Guilford Landfill site), don\\'t repeat our mistake. This is an extraordinary getaway for people who want to retreat from busy city life.\", \"I stayed at David\\'s cottage for a family getaway this summer. The whole experience was amazing. David made sure that we knew everything about the property ahead of time and the place was in perfect condition when we arrived. It was the perfect isolated getaway that we were looking for. The lake was nice and warm for swimming and with lots of seating both at the water and around the fire pit there was always somewhere to relax and enjoy nature. We didn\\'t get to use the sauna this time around, but it looked great and we will be sure to next time. There were enough beds for everyone (all nice and clean) so no one had to sleep on a couch. The fire pit had grills for cooking, so we were able to stay outside all weekend, not getting cooped up in the cottage. I would absolutely recommend this property to anyone looking for a nice getaway from the busy world. I will 100% be returning to David\\'s cottage.\", \"David\\\\u2019s place is truly an amazing experience. The notion of \\\\u201cprivate lake\\\\u201d is not an understatement. I visited the cottage with 9 other friends and it was beyond all of our expectations. If you do not need a phone for a weekend this is truly the place to stay. Authentic cottage, separate bunky cabin, sauna, outdoor shower... 10/10 stay, would book again. David is also an amazing host and instantly helped us out of a jam when our car would not start on the way out... not even that hiccup could ruin the experience.\", \"Charming, rustic spot with a beautiful private lake! Dave\\'s place is very basic but it\\'s what makes it charming. A great escape from the city!\", \"Bushman\\\\r\\\\n\", \"By phone 24/7\\\\nMost guests will enjoy the unique chance to be on their own , but any level of hosting can be negotiated. I might show up for check in and out depending on which way the wind is blowing me on those days.\", \"The pictures of this place don\\\\u2019t do it justice. As soon as we arrived it was clear we were in for a great weekend.\", \"an amazing private retreat for a group,beautiful lake all to yourselves, a rustic, but perfectly maintained main cottage with cool, little bunkie.Sauna was an excellent addition as it heated water for the cabin as well as a outdoor shower, the dock out on the lake was a perfect spot to relax and the fire pit was handy for its nice size grill, good spot\", \"Great location would come back anytime\", \"David\\'s cottage is absolutely amazing! David answered all our questions and concerns quickly and helped whenever we had questions during our stay. The lake and view is worth every pennie! The cottage itself is beautiful and has alot of amenities such as the sauna and hot water system. 100% will be booking again soon.\", \"This cottage is something out of the past. You get to have your peace and quiet away from the crazy city life and just be in tune with nature. My cell battery lasted me the whole long weekend there and it usually doesn\\\\u2019t last me half a day. It feels good to be away from those kind of distractions and have a breath of fresh air with a view of a private lake and Be surrounded by trees. The view of the sky at night is breathtaking with no city lights around and the lake was much nicer than we had thought. \", \"This was a great experience. Our group enjoyed the seclusion of the cabin and private lake.\\\\n\\\\nI recommend bringing a canoe. We spent most of our time in ours out on the water fishing or swimming. \\\\n\\\\nWe did all of our cooking on the fire pit. I recommend bringing charcoals.\\\\n\\\\nDavid was a great host and was available 24/7.\\\\n\\\\nI would definitely return for another stay.\", \"Best Airbnb experience ever! David is super nice and patient. He will give you very detailed information about almost anything you will ever need to know during the stay.\\\\n\\\\nThe property is stunning and private. We all had great fun. Pictures can\\\\u2019t show how beautiful it is.\\\\n\\\\nP.S. the raccoons in the grass at night kinda scared my girlfriend but surely they were harmless.\", \"This place is amazing! My friends and I we all love this place. Those pictures on Airbnb just can\\\\u2019t show how beautiful this place is! You have to see it with your own eyes. David is patient and hospitable, he answered all my questions and give me a lot of advice to make our stay more comfortable and unforgettable!\", \"We\\'re only a couple of hours removed from staying at Michabo, and miss the place already! Michabo really is one of the most beautiful, private locations you could ever imagine. Dave is an exemplary Airbnb host, and goes out of his way to make sure his guests are taken care of. Have had some amazing times here already, and am looking forward to making some more memories the next time around. Thanks again!\", \"This was our third trip here and we are already looking forward to coming back next year. You can\\'t beat this amazing spot. Beautiful property, amazing water, privacy and so peaceful. David is a great host who respects the great outdoors, always asks for ways that he can improve the experience for others. \\\\n\\\\nLots of extra space to pitch tents, lots of pots/pans in the kitchen, great grilling pit, heavenly sauna/shower. I would do anything to live here!\", \"Pictures absolutely don\\'t do this place justice. The cabin is beautiful, rustic and spacious. Being on a private lake is such a treat, the water is gorgeous and calm and we took full advantage of the huge floating dock and the jumping rocks. David is an excellent communicator and a wonderful host. Folks in my group have come twice and we\\'re definitely going to make this an annual thing- five stars!\", \"Perfect. Nothing better. We were blown away by this property, it is stunning and comfortable. I wouldn\\'t change a thing. It\\'s great to have total privacy in such a pristine environment. David was incredibly hospitable and a real gent. Thnaks!\", \"Quiet, picturesque and peaceful. A getaway from the city in every way! Off grid living at its most luxurious! Outdoor showers, saunas and an outhouse with a view. Our group of 9 had more than enough space and loved every minute of the experience. Dave is helpful and always a call away. \", \"This place is a treasure from the past totally, if you have parents or grandparents who talk about the good old days, then you must visit and stay. They don\\'t tell you about the wonderful stars at night or wolf howls or bear poop in the back lane, but they also don\\'t remember stinky outhouse or making a fire to last all night and  stay warm. Most of all they wont tell you about cooking a 22lb Turkey and Thanksgiving dinner the old fashioned way. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nIt\\'s a must do. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nStayed here with my kids ages 24, 22, 20 and 4, perfect escape, with no electricity, but there is cell data service, so you do have the best of both worlds if you have a battery back-up.  \", \"We love Michabo! Thank you :)\", \"David is a wonderful and attentive host who obviously cares about your experience on this unique property. This was our second trip to this cabin and we would do anything to stay here forever. This is paradise and an unbelievably serene experience. The lake is stunning and the cabin is quite spacious. Potentially my favorite place in Ontario. \", \"Wonderful cottage, fantastic scenery, beautiful lake for swimming and fishing! All round a brilliant place to stay! Very authentic Canadian feel to the place and Dave was an absolute gentleman helping us plan our trip! \", \"There was absolutely nothing that could have made this experience any better. the perfect getaway for anyone who just wants to get away from everything. The cabin was amazing, the surroundings were jaw dropping and our host david couldn\\'t have been more accommodating, reiterating multiple times that we could call him at any time with any questions or concerns. We will be rebooking for multiple weekends for years to come. An absolute pleasure.\", \"David\\'s property well exceeded expectations, pictures could never do this place justice. A truly secluded paradise for those who enjoy simplicity at the cottage. I will absolutely be back here with friends and family in the future! \", \"We had the most wonderful stay on Lake Michabo - relaxing and completely private, we were in heaven.

We stayed two nights and David was available by phone to answer any questions at any time. Not that there were too many questions, the cabin was well set up for our convenience. The lack of electricity actually made the stay that much more enjoyable - without electronics we were able to enjoy the beautiful private lake and land. The cabin and bunk house slept 10 very comfortably. We will definitely be contacting David for future visits.\", \"We had an AMAZING LONG WEEKEND at Dave\\'s cabin. The lake is completely private and the cabin is beautiful. The pictures don\\'t do justice to how great the place really is. We spent the whole weekend swimming, sitting in the sauna and cooking great food on the fire pit. Ten adults were more than comfortable. The cabin provides just about everything you\\'d need including firewood, hot water and a propane fridge. For us this was the perfect mix of creature comforts and rustic living. Dave was very helpful and always available. He ensured we were completely comfortable with the operation of the property before leaving us to enjoy the lake. None of us wanted to leave and we will definitely be coming back. Perfect for families or friend groups.  \\\\r\\\\nIf you want to feel like Francis Mallmann in Patagonia, this place is for you. \", \"Dave was a wonderful host and the cottage was absolutely beautiful.

Dave was an incredible host.  Very accommodating, and makes every effort to make sure everything is in order prior to arrival.  Accommodations are exactly as displayed.  Beautiful setting.  Would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for an off-grid getaway.\", \"this is my 2nd tour @ David\\'s property, 2.5hours away from city, very rugged and totally private. we had an unforgetable 3 days hunting/fishing trip for group of six, and we are planning come back at anytime next year\", \"Couldn\\'t have been happier with this amazing spot. A perfect retreat from the the city. Dave was helpful and made himself readily available. The place has a rustic off-grid feel, yet provided our group of 10 all the comforts we needed. Our friends from Ireland were blown away. A great way to experience the best of what Canada has to offer. I will be back!\", \"This beautiful property is definitely undersold in the listing. The property itself is huge and was perfect for our stay, and the cottage and workshop comfortably fit 9 of us with plenty of extra room. The cottage used to be a research camp of sorts, and is filled with character. The view from the private lake was lovely, and the privacy offered us the opportunity to not worry about causing a disturbance or being disturbed. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nPerhaps most importantly, Dave made it clear he was available 24 hours a day, and didn\\'t hesitate to help when we called him with a few queries. Our entire group has nothing but good things to say about Dave and his property, and we\\'ll absolutely be back.\", \"We rented David\\'s Total Privacy Haliburton place and really liked it. David is an amazing host and is available 24/7 for any questions that you have. This is an amazing place to spend few days. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nWe also stayed at David\\'s \\\\\"Stay in Rugged Haliburton Highlands\\\\\" on the same trip - This place is heaven on earth. Beautiful quite area with private access to the lake. We really enjoyed our stay. I highly recommend David\\'s both places to anyone who wants have the best cottage experience of their lives. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe natural beauty of both places are breathtaking. The combination of best host (David) and the cottages equals to a memorable cottage experience.  Simply the best! \", \"The gals and I had a fabulous time at Michabo. It was exactly the kind of spot we were looking for - private, gorgeous, and surrounded by forest. The dock was wonderful for spending the day in the sun, the hills are nice and tough for jogging, the water clear and refreshing for swimming, the sauna is a great touch and the lake produced a nice bass for part of supper Saturday! We brought linens and water and were very happy with the kitchen - well equipped and large enough to allow for many helping hands. We also made great use of the grills by the fire pit, which were very handy. The rope swing across the lake gave a few of us a run for our money! David was helpful and informative, helping us figure out exactly how to make it a perfect stay. Definitely, definitely recommend this to anyone seeking a more rustic back to nature getaway.\", \"This cottage is awesome!  Very rugged and totally private.  Beautiful little private lake with good fishing and lots of space to explore.  David was very helpful and available leading up to our vacation.  Loved the sauna and outdoor shower and tub especially.  We\\'ll definitely be going back!\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThanks David :)\", \"Our stay at this private lake was wonderful! My large group and I love camping, so this property was a real treat - complete privacy, the entire lake to ourselves, space for everyone, and a fire pit. The cabin was even better than expected, with a fridge, stove-top, lanterns, and a wood stove. It\\'s super cosy. Many among my group said the outdoor shower was the best they\\'ve ever had IN THEIR LIVES! The sauna, too, was the perfect way to warm up after a dip in the lake. We would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for privacy and a rustic experience. Everyone in my group is telling me they want to go back. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nDavid was a great person to get to know, very helpful, and available 24/7 if I had any questions. I have nothing bad to say. \\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nThe only thing I\\'d note is the dirt road to get to the cabin can be a bit treacherous, so I wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone with a very low car, and I wouldn\\'t drive at night. Ultimately, we didn\\'t have any trouble though. \", \"I can\\'t recommend this place more. Dave was available anytime for any questions we had, and the cabin was the perfect balance of a rustic back-to-nature experience and a comfortable cottage stay. Warming up in the wood fire sauna, cooking on the firepit, and having a whole lake to yourself swimming as the sun comes up are experiences you simply won\\'t have at a regular cottage. Getting away and being off the grid was something I definitely appreciated. I will for sure be heading back up there again!\", \"Dave was very quick to respond to us and was always available by phone whenever we needed any tips or help on working things in the cottage. He gave us some very helpful suggestions in preparation for our trip.\\\\r\\\\nWe loved the authenticity and privacy of the cottage. The decor, furniture, and overall estate had such unique old-school characters. A few of us also got to enjoy the sauna, which was perfect for a rainy day. The hiking trails were interestingly fun as well, and invited a sense of adventure.\", \"Serene, peaceful, and total privacy. That\\'s what we experienced while staying at Dave\\'s property. A great host, he walked us through the entire process, and prepared ourselves with one of the best cottaging experience we\\'ve ever had. Your own private lake, a nice and cozy 4 bedroom cottage, nestled in a 450 acred wooded paradise. Fishing, hiking, to all your heart\\'s content. It was just starting to get chilly at night, but the wood burning fireplace kept the place nice and inviting. Would definitely go back in a heart beat!\", \"Our long weekend at David\\'s cottage on Michabo Lake was incredible. We loved the landscapes, the privacy and the rawness of the cottage/cabin experience. The sauna and the outdoor bathtubs are also highlights. David was really great to communicate with from the time of the booking to our stay. We will definitively be back!\\\\r\\\\n\", \"Michabo Lake was a paradise getaway -- it was very sad leaving it behind on our last day. The dock on the lake is like being at the bottom of your own private amphitheatre surrounded by the forested hills. The cottage has a unique rustic feel about it but is very intelligently designed and comfortable. Our weekend was exceptionally rainy, and so the sauna was another magical corner for hanging out. David was a great host -- really easy going and very helpful. Our group is definitely planning on coming back. Thanks David! \", \"my family had wonderful time before Canada\\'s day long weekend, dave is extremely nice guy to dealing with, i\\'ve already shared my story with friends n  planning to come back soon.\", \"The place was excellent. It really was great privacy with exclusive use of the lake and trails near by.

The cabin was just what we all needed to escape our busy schedules and have an awesome guys weekend of fishing and shenanigans. If you appreciate historic amenities, like iron wood fire stoves and antique ice boxes, this place doubles as an awesome museum for Ontario history. The beds were quite comfortable and the cabin clean and tidy when we arrived. The sauna and outdoor tub added to the trip\\\\u2019s rustic luxury. Stay to the right on the little dirt road, and just when you think you\\\\u2019re lost, you\\\\u2019ll find yourself in a little forest oasis. Bring a rod, and hit the dock. Well worth the journey from Alaska.\", \"This retreat was great. It was private, rustic and relaxing. The lake is much larger than I thought and the water was great to swim in. The cottage and cabins were exactly what we were looking for. Thanks David!\", \"Outstanding, historical, relaxing.\\\\nIt\\\\u2019s hard to describe the beauties with words.\\\\nReally hope all visitors take good care of the place and keep it just the way it is.\", \"Stayed here multiple times.

It was an enjoyable experience and I look forward to come again next time!\", \"We had an amazing 3 days at Dave\\'s cottage! The private lake was beautiful and the perfect size, and we loved the diving rock/rope swing on the other side of the lake. The cabin was the perfect size for 10 of us all, very cozy and comfortable. The Sauna was also amazing along with the fire pit to keep us entertained and warm at night. Would definitely come back anytime.\", \"David was very helpful in everyday possible. He made us feel very welcome and we were so lucky to experience and stay at his beautiful property. We were in a group of 10 and spent the entire weekend at his property, with our own private lake, sauna and walking trails to explore. It was a great escape from the city. Will definitely recommend this place and David as a host to any fellow traveller. \", \"David\\'s place is absolutely amazing! I would definitely recommend it to any group hoping to get out into the \\\\\"wilderness\\\\\" and take a break from the city-scape. Me and a group of 9 others went out to this home for a weekend away and really enjoyed swimming in the (private) lake, stoking fires (indoor and outdoor) and generally taking a break from technology in a very quaint and very removed setting. \\\\r\\\\nThank you so much David!\"]'"

       "      <td>I stayed at David's cottage for a family getaway this summer. The whole experience was amazing. David made sure that we knew everything about the property ahead of time and the place was in perfect condition when we arrived. It was the perfect isolated getaway that we were looking for. The lake was nice and warm for swimming and with lots of seating both at the water and around the fire pit there was always somewhere to relax and enjoy nature. We didn't get to use the sauna this time around, but it looked great and we will be sure to next time. There were enough beds for everyone (all nice and clean) so no one had to sleep on a couch. The fire pit had grills for cooking, so we were able to stay outside all weekend, not getting cooped up in the cottage. I would absolutely recommend this property to anyone looking for a nice getaway from the busy world. I will 100% be returning to David's cottage.</td>\n",

The lake and sauna are very relaxing and should definitely be enjoyed. The cabin is very well equipped and comes with chopped firewood so the stay can be easy. Dave was a great host and a phone call away to answer our questions. Will definitely consider returning!!   \n",

It is extremely rare that you can find such a secluded place with all lake just for you. The cottage actually has everything that you need, it accomdates 10 people comfortably, and everything is in good condition. The shower is outside the sauna, but really the water in the lake is so warm, that we never used that shower. The forest around the cottage is amazing and full of life. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Also, please take into account that you need to have enough space in your trunk to pick up your garbage (the nearest landfill is the West Guilford Landfill site), don't repeat our mistake. This is an extraordinary getaway for people who want to retreat from busy city life.   \n",

       "4  i stayed at david s cottage for a family getaway this summer the whole experience was amazing david made sure that we knew everything about the property ahead of time and the place was in perfect condition when we arrived it was the perfect isolated getaway that we were looking for the lake was nice and warm for swimming and with lots of seating both at the water and around the fire pit there was always somewhere to relax and enjoy nature we didn t get to use the sauna this time around but it looked great and we will be sure to next time there were enough beds for everyone all nice and clean so no one had to sleep on a couch the fire pit had grills for cooking so we were able to stay outside all weekend not getting cooped up in the cottage i would absolutely recommend this property to anyone looking for a nice getaway from the busy world i will be returning to david s cottage    \n",
